## Description
  
My goal for this project was to create the backend for an Ecommerce website.  Including ORM models.


## Installation
  
To use this application first download the repository from Github.  Then you want to open the folder in your integrated terminal.  Create the DB by running schema.sql in the db folder.  Next run npm run seed to seed the DB with data.  Finally run npm run start.  This will start the server.  Now you can run request against the server to get back data.
